 Tic-Tac-Toe
 
Tic Tac Toe is a simple,two player game that,if played optimally by both players ,will always result in a tie.The game is also called noughts and crosses or Xs and Os

How the game Works

In a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who is playing "X" always goes first. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid are filled. If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then the game is a draw.
